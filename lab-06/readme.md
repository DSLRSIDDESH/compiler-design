Given a CFG as an input file in which each line is having exactly one production rule and epsilon as #.

 Write a c program to compute the first and follow sets of both T & NT (Terminals & Non-terminals) in the given CFG. (NT-Capital letters, T-small letters).

Your program should work for any CFG that can be given as an i/p file.
